# Winner Detection - Enhanced Implementation

## ðŸ”„ Updated Approach

### Image Capture Strategy
- **Multiple Attempts**: Captures a NEW image for each of the 3 retry attempts
- **Fresh Data**: Each attempt gets a different moment in time, increasing chances of success
- **Fallback Image**: If all attempts fail, displays the FIRST captured image (not the last)

### Retry Logic Flow
1. **Attempt 1**: Capture image â†’ Detect persons/chairs â†’ Analyze overlap
2. **Attempt 2**: Capture NEW image â†’ Detect persons/chairs â†’ Analyze overlap
3. **Attempt 3**: Capture NEW image â†’ Detect persons/chairs â†’ Analyze overlap

### Success vs Failure
- **Success**: Returns cropped winner image from the successful attempt
- **Failure**: Returns first captured image for consistent user experience

### Why This Approach?
- **Dynamic Scenes**: People might still be moving/settling after music stops
- **Better Detection**: Different lighting/positions in each frame
- **User Experience**: First image shows initial state when music stopped
